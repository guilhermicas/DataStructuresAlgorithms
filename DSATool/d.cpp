/*
Create an interface to instanciate data-structures and interact with them (C++)
Objective:
start
numbered list to choose which data structure to instanciate and interact with.
operate on the data structure
exit

Beggining data structures to support:
1.Linked List(Array and Dinamic Memory version, doubly-linked list)
2.Stack
3.Queue(Priority, Circular)
4.Trees
5.Binary Trees(AVL Tree, BST, Binary tree, self balancing, B-tree)
6.Heaps
6.Graphs
7.Hash Tables

On the future implement a lot of these :)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures

I want to organize each data structure code in a folder that represents the category of that data-structure, ex:
Tree Folder-Â¬
            v
            Binary Tree.c
            AVL Tree.c
            etc...c

       based on choice, create an instance of the data-structure, and get from the data-structure definition the list of available implemented operations so the user can choose

       Maybe the code inside the switch case would be implemented as interface in the data-structure implementation
